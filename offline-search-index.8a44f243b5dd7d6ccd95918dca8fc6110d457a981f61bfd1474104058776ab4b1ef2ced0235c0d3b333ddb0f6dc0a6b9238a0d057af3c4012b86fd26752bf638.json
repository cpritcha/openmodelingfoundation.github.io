The standards goals and minimum implementation standards aim to capture concerns and practices among the members of OMF.

Overview of Accessibility Standards Goals for Accessibility Standards  Human readable model source code should be openly accessible in archives which adhere to FORCE11 software citation principles and expose their metadata in open, interoperable formats. Model source code should have an appropriate OSI approved license. Authors of published model-based research should make model source code accessible. Funding agencies should require model source code developed in sponsored research to be acccessible and should discourage the use of inaccessible third-party code. Journals require new model source code to be accessible when it is the basis for published articles and should discourage use of inaccessible third-party code. Repositories curating model source code should make that code discoverable by humans and machine search algorithms.  Minimal Accessibility Standards Model code and documentation should be archived in a searchable, open access, trusted digital repository. A DOI, permanent URL or other permanent digital resource locator for accessing the model code must be provided that links to the specific version of the code used. The archive should adhere to FORCE11 software citation principles (https://www.force11.org/software-citation-principles) and expose their metadata in open, interoperable formats like schema.org or codemeta.\nIdeal Accessibility Standards Cyberinfrastructure and Tools for Implementation of Accessibility Standards Examples and References for Accessibility  A list of trusted digital repositories can be found at https://www.comses.net/resources/trusted-digital-repositories/ [perhaps becoming part of OMF website?] OSI approved licenses can be found at https://opensource.org/licenses  Issues / Errata An open question is how to facilitate follow ups to archived versions, such as bug fixes.\nMaking model code and documentation available in a version control system’s repository such as github.com is not recommended as they do not have an explicit mission to serve as a permanent archive and there are no protections or mechanisms to guard against data removal. There is, however, an established workflow, e.g., from GitHub to Zenodo, that ensures proper archival of a GitHub repository with permanent identifiers that resolve to the specific version of archived code.\n","excerpt":"Note These standards promote and enable discovery and access for model code, documentation, and …","ref":"/standards/accessibility/","title":"Accessibility"},{"body":"Note These standards promote documentation needed for others to understand a model and reproduce its results.

Individual application domains may extend these standards to capture additional context relevant to their domain.  Overview of Interoperability Standards Interoperability standards aim to enable models, developed by a diverse scientific community, to be integrated into multi-component modeling environments to represent dynamics and interactions in complex social-natural systems at multiple scales. Standardized APIs and common ontologies, supplementing comprehensive documentation, are essential factors for achieving interoperability. Hence, the goals of interoperability standards include API compatibility and common ontologies so that models can be more readily interconnected as components in an open model ecosystem. There may be multiple implementation technologies to meet these standards.\nQuestions for Assessing Interoperability\n Can the model connect with another model (spatial and temporal synchronization)? Does the model confirm to a standard API (application programming interface)? Are the input and output variables described using a common vocabulary? Are the data types of input and output variables compatible?  Goals for Interoperability Standards OMF Interoperability standards should have the effect of increasing productivity by simplifying a variety of modeling tasks. Tasks that standards should facilitate should include (but are not necessarily limited to):\n Building a coupled model from process-oriented software components (models or model elements) Building \u0026ldquo;system of systems\u0026rdquo; models by assembling sub-models of particular systems (for example, a \u0026ldquo;lake system\u0026rdquo; model integrated with a \u0026ldquo;watershed system\u0026rdquo;) Operating models/components in multiple different frameworks Operating models and data inputs/outputs efficiently as part of a sequence of tasks (approach: use/encourage file formats that are both standardized and open) Swapping input data sources (for example, comparing behavior of a model with two different satellite-based inputs of land cover, as opposed to having the model hard-wired to one particular source) Controlling parameter values and behavior without recompiling Operating a model on multiple platforms Retrieving information about a model\u0026rsquo;s current state (including state variables) (implementation question: direct memory exchange vs. file-based exchange vs. web API) Pausing and continuing model execution Adjusting model variables and/or control parameters during a run (for example, to support data assimilation) Computing derivatives where applicable, to facilitate operations such as sensitivity analysis, optimization, and inference (note: different views among participants about whether this should be included in a standard, a \u0026ldquo;best practice\u0026rdquo; guideline, or not at all) Metadata and documentation related to interoperability  Clarity and precision in definitions of parameters and variables (ontology) Data items to include in metadata: scale (space and time), typical run time, limits (e.g., range of calibration data)    Minimal Interoperability Standards Ideal Interoperability Standards Cyberinfrastructure and Tools for Implementation of Interoperability Standards Cyberinfrastructure and Tools Needed  Tool(s) to automatically test a program\u0026rsquo;s adherence to standards  Examples and References for Interoperability ","excerpt":"Note These standards promote interoperability between models.

Individual application domains may extend these standards to capture additional context relevant to their domain.  Overview of Reusability Standards In this document we are adopting the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine 2019 report on Reproducibility and Replicability in Science definitions of reproducibility and replicability.\n Reproducibility means obtaining consistent computational results using the same input data, computational steps, methods, code, and conditions of analysis. Replicability means obtaining consistent results across studies aimed at answering the same scientific question, each of which has obtained its own data.\n Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific research, especially for transparent evaluation of research claims. Equally important is the potential for scientific procedures to be reused and modified in order to carry out new research. While clear documentation is essential to reusability, new technologies also offer the potential to increase the reproducibility and reusability of model code.\nA critical metric of reproducibility is whether a model can consistently reproduce the published results that claim to have been generated by the model. Reproducibility and reusability can also be enhanced if model code is accompanied by explicit workflows that demonstrate how the model generates and transforms its output data into its published findings.\nGoals for Reusability Standards An independent reviewer should be able to easily download, build, and execute a computational model and verify that it meets the reproducibility claims stated by the model author(s).\nMinimal Reusability Standards This set of minimal standards also can be adopted by journals to ensure that submitted publications meet baseline reproducibility and reusability requirements.\nComputational models must:\n meet OMF minimal standards for Accessibility and Documentation include a minimal set of metadata describing the model including: name, version, description, authors and contributors, OSI approved license, a permanent link to a versioned codebase landing page that broadly follows the FORCE11 software citation guidelines include provenance of all input datasets: permanent links to versioned input data dependencies (and outputs where possible) favor open file formats for data inputs and outputs (e.g., CSV, netCDF, YAML/JSON) provide information on all versioned software and system dependencies (operating system, software and system libraries) with relevant software citations for key dependencies include instructions on how to set up a compute environment to compile / interpret / execute the software  software with large compute or data requirements can be problematic:  provide representative input data samples along with sampling methodology provide durable link to wholetale or other provenance-tracked computation     clearly describe what reproducibility measures or metrics are applicable to the given software provide range of acceptable outcomes for software with stochastic components provide descriptions of possible input parameters and expected outputs with units and format (e.g., shape, data type, etc.) include output analyses and workflows  scripts to transform raw data -\u0026gt; intermediate -\u0026gt; figures subsets of intermediate data if prohibitive to generate    Ideal Reusability Standards In order to meet the ideal standards, computational models should:\n provide durable containerization that follows archival best practices with archived container images provide a link to an active source code repository if still in active development have continuous integration services that compile and run automated unit or integration test suites on a periodic basis include metadata on related research outputs (publications, other software, relationship) additional domain specific standards if any (examples?)

Any modeling scientist can join a Working Group. Working Groups will self organize, and nominate a Working Group Chair, for approval by the Members Council. Working Group Chairs serve for a three-year, renewable term.\nStandards Working Group The Standards Working Group oversees the adoption, dissemination, and administration of Open Modeling Foundation standards for access, documentation, reusability, and interoperability; it may also propose additional standards. It proposes standards to be reviewed, revised, and approved by the Open Modeling Foundation membership. The Standards Working Group helps to communicate Open Modeling Foundation standards to member organizations and other stakeholders, and solicit input from the modeling community. It also establishes procedures to evaluate and certify model code that meets Open Modeling Foundation standards, working with code repositories and scientific software journals to ensure that code review includes Open Modeling Foundation criteria and that any Open Modeling Foundation digital badges are awarded for models that comply with these standards.\nCyberinfrastructure Working Group The Cyberinfrastructure Working Group serves to identify or develop tools and processes which serve to lower the technical barriers towards adoption of the standards developed by the Standards Working Group. The Cyberinfrastructure Working Group also identifies ways to best deploy these tools and sufficient documentation to enable their use to modeling scientists.

Modeling is critical to enhancing analytical and decision-making capabilities for policy and planning, environmental management, resource investment, and security preparedness. We need a new generation of scientific computational models drawn from the social, ecological, biological, environmental, and geophysical sciences that can work together to provide an integrated representation of the complex world in which we now live. This vision can be realized through a common suite of standards, protocols, and best practices that enables modeling scientists to share knowledge and build on one another\u0026rsquo;s research.\n Mission and Goals The Open Modeling Foundation (OMF) is an international open science community that works to enable the next generation modeling of human and natural systems. The Open Modeling Foundation is an alliance of modeling organizations that coordinates and administers a common, community developed body of standards and best practices among diverse communities of modeling scientists. It also provides informational, data, and technological resources to facilitate the implementation of common standards and best practices among the scientific communities it serves.\nThe OMF supports the work of all modeling scientists endeavoring to advance the understanding of diverse dimensions of our complexly interacting human and natural world. The OMF promotes cooperation and transparent knowledge exchange among modeling scientists through common standards and best practices. The OMF develops and maintains an open-access, community framework for enabling an ecosystem of reusable, interoperable models to study complex interactions between people and the environment at multiple scales. The OMF allows scientists and planners world-wide to contribute to developing modeling approaches and applying them to help sustainably manage our planet. Because sustainability is a global challenge, it is important to engage the world in developing and deploying the science needed for this endeavor, and democratize advanced modeling to ensure that all members of our global human community have access to the scientific and decision tools they need.\nThe OMF endeavors to accelerate modeling science by making models more easily discoverable and globally accessible. It also develops and administers a suite of common standards and technology for model reusability, reproducibility, and interoperability. The foundation supports training and educational programs that help modeling scientists develop their skills, learn best practices, and share expertise. OMF member organizations promote transparency and ethical practice of crediting the work of modeling scientists in all domains.\nIn these ways, the Open Modeling Foundation seeks to enable the many scientists across the world who are represented by its member organizations to contribute to nimble, effective modeling of natural systems, human systems, and their integration at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Through fostering innovative modeling science, the Open Modeling Foundation endeavors to help humanity confront rapidly changing and ever more complex and global issues, and improve human well-being.\n Activities The Open Modeling Foundation carries out a series of coordinated activities to further its vision, mission, and goals under the guidance and with the support of the OMF Executive Directorate, Members Council, Working Groups, and member organizations. These activities include, but are not limited to the following.\nCommunity Standards for Modeling Science The OMF coordinates and administers the development or adoption of pan-community standards that accelerate knowledge scaffolding among modeling scientists, and promote the creation and use of more reusable, replicable, interoperable, and reliable models. These standards include:\n  Discoverability and Accessibility: Standards for accessibility ensure that model code is available in FAIR-aligned digital repositories (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reproducible) and that model developers receive public recognition and professional credit for code they make accessible in this way.\n  Documentation: Standards for model documentation ensure that information accompanying model code is sufficiently comprehensive to enable others besides a model developer to understand and potentially replicate the purpose and operation of a model.\n  Reusability and Replicability: Standards aim to facilitate the reuse of a model by others beyond the context in which the model was originally developed; for computational models this includes reusability regardless of the operating system or language in which a model was originally developed. Replicability is not possible without reusability.\n  Interoperability: Standards to enable potential interoperability among different models include pan-community external API and vocabulary (ontology) specifications.\n  The OMF coordinates and administers the certification of models that meet these standards and the assignment of badges or other public indicators of such certification to the general modeling community for code that meets these standards. The OMF also encourages and coordinates peer review of models by the scientific community and other evaluation activities, like model intercomparison programs, to help identify models that meet community standards, and enhance the reliability and value of models.\nOMF modeling standards are living documents that should be reviewed and updated as technology and the needs of the international modeling community evolve. The OMF welcomes and encourages input on standards from members of the broader modeling community and will consider that input as part of the formal standards-making, review, and approval procedures.\nIn addition to standards applicable to model code, the OMF also develops, adopts, and administers community-wide standards for ethical practice by modeling scientists. In order to encourage knowledge exchanges and scaffolding, all modeling scientists should publically credit (normally through citation) the work of any other scientists that they use. In order to maintain the reliability and public reputation of modeling science, practitioners must document accurately model purposes, operations, inputs, boundaries, assumptions, and results. Modeling scientists are also strongly urged to make all models transparent and open to external examination, and to make their models openly accessible to others.\nThese standards for models and modeling science practice are disseminated to all member organizations and publicly displayed on the OMF website.\nResources to Facilitate Model Discoverability, Accessibility, Reuse and Interoperability The OMF may coordinate or develop technologies and databases to help modeling scientists make their models more easily reusable by others and more easily interoperable with other models. Examples of such resources could be software or online services to help scientists containerize computational models in environments like Docker, to transform them into web services, or to add a standardized API to models. Related to this, the OMF may also coordinate or help develop and maintain a common ontology database to facilitate interoperability.\nThe OMF may also adopt and promote common metadata standards for model code repositories to improve discoverability and access for models located across diverse, internationl archives.\nIt may also develop and maintain a global, online index to non-computational models (e.g., numerical, and conceptual) that meet OMF standards for documentation, reuse, and transparency.\nThe OMF may make available to modeling scientists information and guidance about Open Source licensing and other practices for making their work globally accessible.\nTraining and Education The OMF will provide a forum for disseminating materials for teaching best practices for model documentation, transparency, reuse, and interoperability to students in educational institutions. Related to this, the OMF may sponsor training activities to help scientists learn how to make their models more transparent, well-documented, reusable by others, or interoperable with other models. This training could involve in-person workshops, webinars and virtual conferences, or training videos.\nCoordination and Partnerships with Other Organizations The OMF will actively engage with other organizations supporting open, ethical science. It will do so in order to support and promote best practices for modeling science. This could include adopting standards for ethical practice, identifying open access repositories for model code and other information, and obtaining support for licensing and related legal issues.\nThe OMF also will actively engage with journals that publish the results of modeling science. It will encourage these journals to actively support OMF standards by requiring scientists to meet these standards in order to publish their work, and assigning digital badges or other public recognition of authors who do so.\nSeeking Funding The Open Modeling Foundation, through its Administrative Directorate and its member organizations, will seek external funding to support the activities of the foundation.\nAdditional Activities Depending on resource availability, the Open Modeling Foundation may undertake other activities in support of modeling science and scientists. Identifying, prioritizing, and coordinating such activities will be the responsibility of the Executive Directorate and Activities Committees. The following are examples of such activities.\n Membership The Open Modeling Foundation is comprised of organizations that include and represent modeling scientists anywhere in the world. Any such organization can be nominated for membership in the OMF or self-nominate. Nominations will be evaluated by the Executive Directorate and presented to the Membership Council for approval. Membership is supported by donations and assume active voluntary participation of members in the Foundation activities.\n Governance Governance of the Open Modeling Foundation should be organized to achieve four primary goals:\n  It should enable the foundation to carry out its mission and goals, and realize its vision in the most effective way possible and with the least necessary intervention on the part of OMF governance.\n  It should provide a free and fair voice to all member scientific communities it represents.\n  It should offer opportunities for all modeling scientists to participate and contribute to the goals and activities of the OMF.\n  It should seek to maximize benefits for the scientific communities it represents and promote modeling science that benefits both human and natural systems on our planet.\n  The policies and activities of Open Modeling Foundation will be administered by shared, multi-level governance, consisting on a Members Council, Working Groups, and Executive Directorate.\nMembers Council The Members Council is composed of 1 representative from each member organization. The Members Council reviews and approves OMF policies and modeling standards. It provide advices and support to the Executive Directorate and Working Groups for carrying out governance policies, creating and administering standards, and carrying out other activities.

The Executive Directorate is composed of an Executive Director, two representatives elected by the Members Council, and the Chairs of the Working Groups. The two Members Council representatives are elected in staggered two year terms. The Executive Director serves for renewable five year terms. The other members of the Executive Directorate and the Members Council will create a process for selecting an Executive Director.\nThe Executive Directorate ensures that the activities of the Open Modeling Foundation are furthering its vision, mission, and goals as expressed in this charter. It oversees all elections and any other selection of individuals involved in foundation activities to ensure that qualified, ethical individuals who are dedicated to the foundation\u0026rsquo;s vision, mission, and goals are chosen to fill their roles in the foundation. It also oversees the activities committees to ensure that they are carrying out their assigned tasks in an appropriate and effective manner, consistent with the vision, mission, and goals of the foundation. The Executive Directorate receives and evaluates all nominations for membership in the Open Modeling Foundation, and submits them to the Members Council for review and approval vote. The Executive Directorate also manages funding and financial expenditures of the OMF, in accordance with the foundation\u0026rsquo;s vision, mission, and goals. The Executive Directorate may propose changes to the OMF Charter for review and approval by the Membership Council.\nThe Executive Directorate will meet at least quarterly each year. It will organize Members Council meetings. The Executive Director will chair Directorate meetings and Members Council meetings, or identify a substitute from the Directorate if s/he is unable to do so. The Executive Directorate may be supported by OMF staff including an Administrative Coordinator and technical staff.\nWorking Groups In addition to the Executive Directorate, OMF activities are guided by Working Groups. Any modeling scientist can join a Working Group. Working Groups will self organize, and nominate a Working Group Chair, for approval by the Members Council. Working Group Chairs serve for a three-year, renewable term.\nStandards Working Group The Standards Working Group oversees the adoption, dissemination, and administration of OMF standards for access, documentation, reusability, and interoperability; it may also propose additional standards. It proposes standards to be reviewed, revised, and approved by the OMF Members Council. The SWG works with the Executive Directorate and Administrative Coordinator to communicate OMF standards to OMF member organizations and other stakeholders, and solicit input from the modeling community. It also establishs procedures to evaluate and certify model code that meets OFM standards, working with code repositories and scientific software journals to ensure that code review includes OMF criteria and that OMF digital badges are awarded for models that comply with these standards.\nCyberinfrastructure Working Group The Cyberinfrastructure Working Group serves to identify or develop tools and processes which serve to lower the technical barriers towards adoption of the standards developed by the Standards Working Group. The Cyberinfrastructure Working Group also identifies ways to best deploy these tools and sufficient documentation to enable their use to modeling scientists. This Working Group also coordinates the development and management of the OMF Science Gateway. The CWG will be assisted by OMF technical staff in its mission. These OMF technical staff wll be de facto members of CWG, although membership in the CWG is open to others as well.\nOutreach and Education Working Group The Outreach and Education Working Group will coordinate collaborative efforts with journals, funding agencies, societies, institutions/labs, other software/modeling consortia to diseminate and administer OMF standards across the community of modeling science. Depending on available resources, it also may develop and deploy educational and training materials, organize workshops, symposia, clinics, and other promotional or engagement events to disseminate OMF standards and help modling scientists meet those standards. It it is specifically charged with helping the OMF members reach and train next generation scholars and ensure proactive outreach to groups and nationalities that are underrepresented in modeling science This working group is supported by the Administrative Coordinator and may be supported by OMF educational staff.\nAdditional Working Groups Other Working Groups may be proposed by the Executive Directorate to oversee and coordinate additional OMF activities. The establishment of any new working groups must be approved by the Members Council.\n","excerpt":"Open Modeling Foundation Organizational Charter - Draft 0.8 Vision A globally connected humanity is …","ref":"/governance/charter/","title":"Charter"},{"body":"The Open Modeling Foundation (OMF) is an international open science community that works to enable the next generation modeling of human and natural systems. It is an alliance of modeling organizations that coordinates and administers a common, community developed body of standards and best practices among diverse communities of modeling scientists. The OMF also provides informational, data, and technological resources to facilitate the implementation of common standards and best practices among the scientific communities it serves.\nThe OMF supports the work of all modeling scientists endeavoring to advance the understanding of diverse dimensions of our complexly interacting human and natural world. The OMF promotes cooperation and transparent knowledge exchange among diverse communities of modeling scientists through common standards and best practices. The OMF develops and maintains an open-access, community framework for enabling an ecosystem of reusable, interoperable models to study complex interactions between people and the environment at multiple scales. The OMF allows scientists and planners world-wide to contribute to developing modeling approaches and applying them to help sustainably manage our planet. Because sustainability is a global challenge, it is important to engage the world in developing and deploying the science needed for this endeavor, and democratize advanced modeling to ensure that all members of our global human community have access to the scientific and decision tools they need.\nThe OMF endeavors to accelerate modeling science by making models more easily discoverable and globally accessible. It develops and administers a suite of common standards and technology for model reusability, reproducibility, and interoperability. The foundation supports training and educational programs that help modeling scientists develop their skills, learn best practices, and share expertise. OMF member organizations promote transparency and ethical practice of crediting the work of modeling scientists in all domains.\nIn these ways, the Open Modeling Foundation seeks to enable the many scientists across the world who are represented by its member organizations to contribute to nimble, effective modeling of natural systems, human systems, and their integration at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Through fostering innovative modeling science, the Open Modeling Foundation endeavors to help humanity confront rapidly changing and ever more complex and global issues and improve human well-being.\nThe mission and charter of the Open Modeling Foundation are living documents. Scientists can suggest changes through the OMF Github and these suggestions will be incorporated into the mission and charter by the steering committee.\n","excerpt":"The Open Modeling Foundation (OMF) is an international open science community that works to enable …","ref":"/about/","title":"About"},{"body":"Enabling next generation modeling of human and natural systems The Open Modeling Foundation is an alliance of modeling organizations that coordinates and administers a common, community developed body of standards and best practices among diverse communities of modeling scientists.\nGovernance of the Open Modeling Foundation is organized to enable the foundation to carry out its mission and goals, and realize its vision in the most effective way possible.

Select a topic to see standards documents relevant to that topic. See the \u0026ldquo;How to Contribute\u0026rdquo; pages for details on how to participate in the development of community modeling standards.\nDesigning standards In order to develop community wide standards for modeling, it is first necessary to specify the goals of the standards. These state what goals will be met by following the standards.\nOnce the goals of a standard are described, a set of modeling practices, protocols, or technologies to implement those standards and achieve the specified goals can be recommended. It may be useful to differentiate between implementations that meet the standards goals at a minimal level, and could be widely adopted, and ideal implementations that exceed the minimum goals of the standards. There may be more than one implementation that enable modeling to meet the specified goals.\nAs modeling technologies, uses, and practices evolve, modeling standards should also evolve\u0026ndash;both goals and implementations. Hence, these should be considered as living documents that are extensible and evolve to meet the needs and aspirations of the scientific modeling community. They should be versioned to indicate this evolution.\nModeling standards should encourage and support innovation and new ideas in modeling. They should be designed so as to be be applicable to legacy models (making them more useful) as well as new models. To the extent possible, they should be language agnostic to enable wide adoption. They should be accompanied by best practice guidelines, examples, and use cases to test and drive standards development.\nComments and suggestions are welcome and will be carefully considered by the OMF Working Groups and Membership.\n","excerpt":"These pages present current standards in development or adopted by the Open Modeling Foundation. …","ref":"/standards/","title":"Standards"}]
